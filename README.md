# Meet FitBot!

FitBot is a Discord bot that randomly generates set of exercises based on user input.

Can't decide on what exercises to do? FitBot will give you 3 exercises to perform depending on whether you want to do a pull day, push day, leg day, or cardio day!

FitBot was inspired by a recent fitness journey along with my introduction to programming in Python.

## Modules

- discord.py
- random
- dotenv

## Commands

In Discord, as a user you can send FitBot any of the following messages for a set of 3 exercises sent back to you:

- /pull - requests pull day exercises targeting the upper body.
- /push - requests push day exercises targeting the upper body.
- /leg - requests leg day exercises targeting the lower body.
- /cardio - requests cardio day exercises for a heart healty workout.
